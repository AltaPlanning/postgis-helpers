# tests for postgis-helpers

This test suite is implemented with ``ward``.
Documentation for this library can be found 
at [https://wardpy.com](https://wardpy.com)


``fixtures.py`` contains the setup and teardown
code for a local and remote database. This currently
requires that you have a local config file with
``localhost`` and ``digitalocean`` defined.
